## About the game
 - TicTacToe is a simple game where two players exchange moves by placing either X or O on a 3x3 grid. The player who succesfully places three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins the game.

## Late-term assignment
 - This was a late term assignment in the course Software Development in Reykjavik University.
 - The assignment was about creating a basic TicTacToe game while using good coding pracices and infastructures given in the assignment description. Rather than implementing more features into the game, the main focus was on correct coding structure.
